                <h2>Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract for Sofato Travels & Tours Ltd.</h2>

                <h3>Application</h3>

                <p>All services rendered by or on behalf of Travelstart Online Travel Operations (Pty) Ltd (‘Travelstart’) to the Client/s are subject to the terms and conditions (‘the Conditions’) set out below.</p>

                <p>Travelstart, located at Longkloof Studios, Block B, Darters Roads, Gardens, Cape Town, 8001, South Africa is part of the Travellab Group, located at Sebbarp Kvarnhem, 24033, Löberöd, Sweden.</p>

                <p>The following Terms and Conditions should be read and understood prior to confirming your travel. Do not confirm any booking unless you understand and agree with the following terms and conditions.</p>

                <h3>Nature of the services rendered by Travelstart</h3>
                
                <p>Travelstart renders the service of hosting an online search and booking portal, with its primary focus on the travel and accommodation industries (‘the Services’) pursuant to which the general public shall: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>have access to the portal,</li>
                    <li>be entitled to set certain travel, accommodation and/or other service criteria based on information gleaned from the internet,</li>
                    <li>request quotations and</li>
                    <li>be entitled to confirm bookings and place reservations relating to travel, accommodation and/or other service requirements</li>

                </ol>
                <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the services do not include any advisory or consultancy services, unless you choose to speak to a Travelstart Live Agent.</p>

                <h3>The Client and Authority</h3>

                <p>Any person(s) wishing to utilise the services, indicates their acceptance of these Terms and Conditions by proceeding with the booking on the passenger information page, prior to the conclusion of any transaction with Travelstart. Upon doing so, such person is DEEMED TO HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED these Terms and Conditions and to have the authority to do so on behalf of the person in whose name the ultimate reservation or booking is made (collectively referred to as ‘the Client(s)’).</p>

                <p>Please be advised that unless requested otherwise upon making the reservation, Travelstart is authorised to engage with any Passenger listed in a booking, in as long as that Passenger is able to provide the reference number for the booking. Travelstart accepts no responsibility for any changes made by any of the listed Passengers in a booking.</p>

                <h3>Third Party Service Providers</h3>

                <p>Travelstart provides Clients with the services either itself or acting on behalf of Principals engaged in or associated with the travel and/or accommodation industries, such as airlines, hotels and/or other service providers or suppliers (collectively referred to as ‘the Principal’). Travelstart represents the Principal as agents only AND ACCORDINGLY ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY for any loss, damage (including loss of profits or consequential or special damages), injury, illness, harm or death (except if such loss or damage arises from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Travelstart or any person acting for or controlled by Travelstart), which any Client may suffer as a result of any act or omission on the part of or the failure of the Principal to fulfil their obligations, whether in relation to travel arrangements, accommodation or otherwise. The contract in use by the Principal (which is often constituted by the ticket issued by the Principal), shall constitute the sole contract between the Principal and the Client and any RIGHT OF RECOURSE the Client may have, will be solely against the Principal. Travelstart shall, as soon as possible after the confirmation of the Client’s booking, provide to the Client the identity of the Principal and to the extent possible, a copy of the terms and conditions applicable to the Client’s booking with the relevant Principal(s). It is the Client’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with such terms and conditions (‘the Principal’s Conditions’).

                The specific airline's terms and conditions may apply.</p>

                <p>See EAN terms and conditions here.</p>

                <h3>Booking Enquiries & Reservations</h3>

                <p>Once the Client has (i) completed all applicable fields to initiate an enquiry regarding a particular destination, trip, tour, mode of travel, preferred accommodation and/or other service on Travelstart’s website www.travelstart.com.ng or Mobile Application(together, ‘the Sites’), or (ii) initiated such an enquiry with Travelstart by any other means of communication including by means of access to the Sites via booking kiosks, if applicable, (collectively referred to as ‘the Enquiry’), the Sites will prepare and provide the Client with the projected total cost of the Enquiry (online, by e-mail, by SMS or telephonically) (‘the Quote’). THE QUOTE IS ACCEPTED by the Client when the Client proceeds with the steps as specified on the Sites or accepts the Quote telephonically or via email. Full payment of the total value of the Quote (‘the Payment’) is required in order to confirm reservations with the relevant Principals (‘the Booking’). Once the online Booking or Booking affected by Travelstart has been completed and the Client has authorized Travelstart to process the payment by submitting the Booking for reservation, the Client will be supplied with an email that will contain the final details of the Booking (‘the Booking Confirmation Form’). IN THE CASE OF AIR TICKETS, FULL PAYMENT FOR THE BOOKING NEEDS TO BE MADE AND REFLECT IN THE BANK ACCOUNT OF TRAVELSTART BY MIDNIGHT South African time on the day that the Booking was made in order to guarantee the fare quoted according to the Booking Confirmation Form.</p>

                <h3>Destination Selection</h3>

                <p>The Client ACKNOWLEDGES that it has selected the itinerary and destination(s) constituting the Booking based on information gleaned from the internet. It ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES that the internet Booking has been compiled and is managed and updated by the Principal, and that Travelstart has no control over information compiled by the Principal. Accordingly TRAVELSTART CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE that the itinerary and/or any destinations will comply in whole or in part with those advertised on the internet by or on behalf of the Principal. Any right of recourse in that regard will be against the Principal. In addition to the above Travelstart cannot be held liable for incorrect availability being displayed by the Principal and we cannot be held liable if the seats selected are not available.</p>

                <h3>Payment and Payment Terms</h3>

                <p>The Payment is due immediately by Visa, Master, American Express or Diners Credit Card, Electronic Funds Transfer, Cash Deposit at a bank, or if a Kiosk booking, cash payment to the Kiosk teller, whichever is applicable, and must reflect in the bank account of Travelstart by midnight South African time on the day that the Booking was made. If the Payment is not received as stated above, Travelstart or Principal involved RESERVES THE FULL RIGHT TO CANCEL THE BOOKING, in which event the full Payment (less any cancellation and administration fees) shall be refunded to the Client within 48 hours of the cancellation being processed. In the event that the Payment was made after the aforementioned deadline, and should Travelstart inform the Client by means of a revised Quote that the Booking remains available at a higher price, the Client may choose to proceed with the Booking at such higher price, in which event the CLIENT WILL BE LIABLE for any difference between the original Quote and such higher price, and the revised Payment must reflect in the bank account of Travelstart before the deadline stipulated in the revised Quote in order to secure the Booking.</p>

                <p>Travelstart is a South African company and all transactions are processed in South African Rand. The applicable conversion charges (‘Additional Charges’) may therefore be levied by your merchant bank if payment is made from another country and/or in another currency other than South African Rand. The Additional Charges are driven by the global treasury of the applicable credit card and are impacted by the change in daily exchange rates. Travelstart shall therefore NOT BE HELD LIABLE for any Additional Charges levied by the applicable merchant, or bank pursuant to the confirmation of a Booking.</p>

                <h3>Quotes</h3>

                <p>Quotes are provided at the ruling daily exchange rate. Until Travelstart has received Payment, we RESERVE THE RIGHT to amend any Quote. Should the Quote be increased as a result of an exchange rate fluctuation, the CLIENT UNDERTAKES TO PAY FOR ANY INCREASE ON DEMAND. Any decrease in the QUOTE prior to the date of Payment will be reflected in the Quote itself. The onus will be on the Client to check that there have been no changes in the Quote prior to making the Payment. Airfares are subject to the price and conditions quoted by the airlines. However, once Payment has been received, the Quote is guaranteed, PROVIDED THAT the payment was made by midnight on the day that the Booking was made. Should the Client be a group booking and the group number deviate from the number required for the Booking, the PRINCIPAL MAY RESERVE THE RIGHT to re-cost the Quote and raise a surcharge. Should any Client refuse to accept and pay such surcharge, it may result in the Principal CANCELLING THE BOOKING AND RETAINING any payment made, and Travelstart will be entitled to retain any service fees charged.</p>

                <h3>Service Fee</h3>

                <p>These fees cover the costs incurred by Travelstart in booking and servicing your travel reservation. We also reserve the right to charge an additional service fee for any additional services rendered, such as cancellation requests or changes to your booking. <br>

                Please be advised that service fees and products are non-refundable in case of a cancellation.</p>

                <h3>Amendment Fees</h3>

                <p>An amendment fee per Booking may be levied for any changes to the confirmed itinerary and or ticket. The Travel Agent’s amendment fee is charged in addition to any amendment fees which may be charged by the relevant Principal.</p>

                <h3>Travelstart’s Indemnity</h3>

                <p>The proposed travel arrangements are made on the EXPRESS CONDITION that Travelstart, its employees and agents, shall not be responsible for, and shall be exempt from, all liability in respect of loss, damage (including loss of profits or consequential or special damages), accident, injury, illness, harm, trauma, death, delay or inconvenience (collectively, ‘Losses’) to any Client (which shall be deemed to include the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of the Client), their luggage, or other property, wherever, whenever and however the same may occur (except if such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Travelstart or any person acting for or controlled by Travelstart, in which case such claim shall be lodged in writing with Travelstart within 30 (thirty) days after the occurrence of the alleged Loss, and such liability shall be limited to R10 000 per Client per Booking). The CLIENT INDEMNIFIES AND HOLDS HARMLESS Travelstart or any person acting for or controlled by Travelstart accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Insurance</h3>

                <p>It is STRONGLY ADVISED that all Clients take out adequate insurance cover in order to cover instances such as cancellation due to illness or injury, personal accident and personal liability, loss of or damage to baggage and sports equipment. (Note that this is not an exhaustive list). Travelstart will NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE if the Client fails to take adequate insurance cover. It shall not be obligatory upon Travelstart to effect insurance for the Client (since this service does not fall within the scope of the Services) except upon detailed instructions given in writing by the Client. All insurance effected by Travelstart pursuant to such instruction will be subject to such exceptions and conditions as may be imposed by the insurance company or underwriters accepting the risk. Travelstart shall NOT BE OBLIGED to obtain separate cover for any risks so excluded. Should the insurers dispute their liability for any reason, the Client will have recourse against the insurers only. Please note that various credit card companies offer limited levels of travel insurance, which in Travelstart’s view may not be sufficient cover for international travel. The CLIENT IS ADVISED to check with their respective credit card companies in order to obtain the specific details of the cover offered, and determine whether this is sufficient for the Client’s requirements.</p>

                <h3>Travel Documents</h3>

                <p>Documents (for example booking confirmations, itineraries etc.) shall only be prepared and released to the Client on receipt of the Payment.</p>

                <h3>Name Change Requests</h3>

                <p>Upon confirming your booking we advise you to CHECK THE SPELLING OF YOUR NAME and ensure that it is as per your passport/identity document. Should the spelling of your name not match your passport/identity document the airline may not allow you to board the plane or should you require a name change, and should it be permissible, airline penalties may apply. Please note that some airlines do not allow name changes for any reason whatsoever and may require you to buy a completely new ticket. Travelstart accepts no liability in this regard.</p>

                <h3>Passports, Visas & Health</h3>

                <p>It is ENTIRELY THE CLIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that all passports and visas are current, valid, obtained on time, have sufficient blank pages, will be valid for six months after return to their home country and that any vaccinations, inoculations, prophylactic (e.g. for malaria) and the like, where required, have been obtained. The Client is STRONGLY ADVISED to check the relevant requirements for their destination and any transit countries before travelling. Travelstart will endeavour to assist the Client if requested, but such assistance will be at Travelstart’s discretion (since this service does not fall within the scope of the Services) and the Client acknowledges that in doing so, Travelstart IS NOT ASSUMING ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY AND THE CLIENT INDEMNIFIES TRAVELSTART against any consequences of the Client’s failure to comply with any such requirements. It is the CLIENT’S DUTY to familiarize him/herself with the inherent dangers of and mental and/or physical condition required for the proposed travel arrangementss</p>

                <h3>Warning: Malaria and other tropical Diseases</h3>

                <p>Certain parts covered by the Client’s itinerary may be areas where there is a HIGH-RISK of malaria and other tropical diseases such as yellow fever. It is ENTIRELY THE CLIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY to check if any parts of their itinerary fall in high-risk areas and the Client is STRONGLY ADVISED to take the necessary precautions in this regard and hence we recommend that the Client checks with their medical practitioner and/or travel clinic well before departure.</p>

                <h3>Cancellation</h3>

                <p>In the event of the Client cancelling the Booking, Travelstart shall have the RIGHT TO EITHER CLAIM the amount of, or retain an amount of the Payment and claim reasonable damages suffered by Travelstart, provided that Travelstart shall not impose any cancellation fee or claim any damages in respect of a Booking or reservation if the Client is unable to honour the Booking or reservation due to the death or hospitalisation of the Client. The Principals may reserve the RIGHT TO CANCEL any services prior to departure, in which event the Payment (less Travelstart’s service fee) will be refunded by the Principal to the Client without any further obligation on the part of Travelstart. Travelstart will CHARGE A FEE for processing the request for refund. Clients should refer to the “Refunds” section of these Conditions, as well as the cancellation provisions contained in the Principal’s Conditions or the Sites. Principals may charge cancellation fees over and above the cancellation fees charged by Travelstart in terms of this Condition.</p>

                <h3>Unscheduled Extensions</h3>

                <p>In the unlikely event of there being an unscheduled extension to the final itinerary caused by flight re-scheduling, flight delays, bad weather, strikes or any other cause which is beyond the control of Travelstart, its agents or the Principal, any EXPENSES RELATING TO SUCH UNSCHEDULED EXTENSIONS (HOTEL ACCOMMODATION ETC.) WILL BE FOR THE CLIENT’S ACCOUNT. The Client should confirm whether any of these expenses may be covered by travel insurance, should this be applicable. It is the Client’s responsibility to confirm the specific provisions of the travel insurance.</p>

                <h3>Itinerary Variations & Transfers</h3>

                <p>While every effort is made to keep to the final itinerary, the Principals reserve the right to make changes intended for the Client’s convenience e.g. in some cases, weather conditions can necessitate an alteration in the itinerary. Any such variations in the final itinerary do not constitute any reason for a refund and Travelstart shall NOT BE HELD LIABLE for any such variations. IT IS THE CLIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY to check each amendment to the itinerary. Please note that no passenger who has not utilised an outgoing flight on a return ticket will be allowed to make use of the return trip, except where , should it be permissible, prior arrangement has been made with the airline.</p>

                <h3>Law & Jurisdiction</h3>

                <p>These Conditions shall be governed by the law of South Africa and the jurisdiction of South African courts will govern the relationship between the Client and Travelstart. Travelstart SHALL BE ENTITLED to institute any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with this contract in any Magistrates Court having jurisdiction in terms of Section 28 of the Magistrates Court Act no. 32/1944 as amended, notwithstanding that the amount in issue may exceed the limits of such jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>Special Requests</h3>

                <p>Clients who have special requests must specify such requests in writing to Travelstart at least 48 hours prior to their outbound flight. Whilst Travelstart will use its best endeavors to accommodate any such requests, it does NOT GUARANTEE that it will always be able to do so.</p>

                <h3>Amendments of these Conditions</h3>

                <p>No amendment, cancellation or waiver of any term or right referred to herein shall be valid or binding unless reduced to writing and signed by both the Client and a duly authorized representative of Travelstart.</p>

                <h3>Refunds</h3>

                <p>NO REFUNDS will be considered in any circumstances whatsoever by Travelstart if the Client has not purchased the “Trip Cancellation and Refund Guarantee Policy” at the time of making the booking. Refunds by the Principals will be subject to their respective terms and conditions. Travelstart will charge a fee for processing a request for refund. Principals may charge refund fees above those stated here.<br>

                Once we have established the possible refund you are entitled to, we will request it with the airline or hotel on your behalf. For flight bookings the refund will be made by the airline directly to the account the booking was originally paid with. This can take 6 to 8 weeks depending on the airline. For hotel bookings, the supplier will refund Travelstart and we’ll refund the credit card you used when making your reservation. This usually takes approximately 4 weeks.</p>

                <h3>Foreign Exchange Regulation Compliance</h3>

                <p>Foreign Exchange Regulation Compliance is EXCLUSIVELY THE CLIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY. This will apply especially when the Client instructs Travelstart to make and pay for travel arrangements on the internet.</p>

                <h3>E-ticketing: Documents required for travelling</h3>

                <p>It is the CLIENT’S EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that he/she is in possession of all relevant travel documents prior to commencing with his/her travels. For example, the Client must be ready to show their passport or identity document and e-ticket at the check-in counter of the airline concerned, or, to the extent applicable, their passport or identity document at the check-in counter for their accommodation. Certain airlines require the physical credit card, used to make payment, to be presented at check-on or a copy of the credit card and the card-holders ID, in addition the above mentioned documents. The requirement to have a valid passport or identity document an/or an unabridged birth certificate will apply to all members of a travelling party and for each minor travelling (including infants).</p>

                <h3>Internet Bookings</h3>

                <p>If the Client requests or instructs Travelstart to effect bookings via the internet, the Client IRREVOCABLY AUTHORIZES Travelstart to do the following on its behalf (1) make any selections of and for the proposed travel arrangements (2) inform the Client of the prices attached to the proposed travel arrangements PRIOR TO CONFIRMING the booking and (3) make payment for such booking and ancillary services.</p>

                <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

                <p>TRAVELSTART, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SERVANTS OR AGENTS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY SUFFERED BY ANY PERSON WHETHER TO THEIR PERSON OR PROPERTY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY ACT, OMISSION, DEFAULT, OR NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF TRAVELSTART, UNLESS SUCH CLAIM IS DUE TO THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILFUL CONDUCT OF TRAVELSTART AND SUCH CLAIM IS LODGED IN WRITING WITH TRAVELSTART WITHIN 30 (THIRTY) DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE BOOKING IS MADE. SUCH LIABILITY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A LIMITATION OF R10 000 PER CLIENT PER BOOKING AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TRAVELSTART BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE.</p>

                <h3>Legal Fees</h3>

                <p>In the event that Travelstart has to engage a lawyer to enforce any of its rights in terms of these Conditions or otherwise, and in the event that Travelstart is successful in the enforcement of such rights, the CLIENT WILL BE LIABLE for all legal fees at an attorney and own client scale.</p>

                <h3>Confidentiality</h3>

                <p>Subject to statutory constraints or compliance with an order of court, Travelstart undertakes to deal with all Client information of a personal nature on a strictly confidential basis.</p>

                <h3>Confirmation of Travel Arrangements</h3>

                <p>it is advisable that all onward travel arrangements (local, international and on return to RSA, domestic connecting flights) be RECONFIRMED BY THE CLIENT 72 (seventy-two) hours prior to departure with the airline.</p>

                <h2>General Terms and Conditions for Online Bookings</h2>
